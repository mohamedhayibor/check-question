## Raison d'être

Everybody becomes happy with better questions. They yield better answers and just makes the internet (world) better.

English is my third language and I have been drilled by the strict rule of asking ["wh" type questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question#wh) and respecting the structure:

1. (what || where || how || why || who || when)
2. question mark `?` at the end.

I still think that this structure just prompts you in asking better questions.
